1.	Use the Data Exploratory Analysis to explore the equity returns including descriptive statistics, histogram, distribution curves, boxplot, and correlation analysis and so on.  
2.	Based on returns for equity and market index. Use two factor models (time series regression) to compute the alpha estimation of all equities. The two factor models are the market model (CAPM model) and Fama-French 5 factor separately. 
3.	Create frequency distribution of t-ratios of the alphas (intercepts in each model) following the analysis on lecture notes of chapter 3&4 (page 31: An Example of the Use of a Simple t-test to Test a Theory in Finance)
4.	From the step 3, identify how many assets outperform significantly at 5% of alpha level.
